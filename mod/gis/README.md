Layers

User can add a new layer to  map, layer could be a vector layer, image layer or tile layer.

Vector layers can be created with giving a geojson file. It could be uploaded or its content could be copied and submitted. Image layers can be created by uploading an image and giving its coordinates where the image should position on the map. Tile layers can be created by selecting which tile layer service user like to have, OpenStreetMaps for example. Visibility of the layers can be toggled by clicking the checkbox in front of the layer name. User can simply edit the layers or delete them as needed.

  

Features

Vector layer consists of one or more pieces called Features. A feature could be a point, a line or an area.  In other words, they can be vertex, polyline, polygon. Clicking on a feature will highlight that feature and it will show all the properties bound to that feature. These properties can be edited or removed. New properties can be added. Properties are like name, value pairs. User can add any property as needed, eg Population : 20330
